## Summary
I am trying to learn the implement user authentication, by way of roles of permissions.

## Motivation
Want to understand how to build or implement user authentication in django / drf apps

## Drawbacks
I Why should we not do this?

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions
What parts of the design are still to be done?
