## Summary
I am trying to learn the implement user authentication, by way of roles of permissions.

## Motivation
Want to understand how to build or implement user authentication in django / drf apps

## Detailed design
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the network to understand, and for somebody familiar with the code practices to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used.

## Drawbacks
I Why should we not do this?

## Alternatives
What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions
What parts of the design are still to be done?
